## First read in the data that you want evaluated
# I took public data from USGS NAS and my average asc file from the ENM
NAS <- read.csv("FRUSHENM/Raster values/NAS Data Trimmed.csv")
ENMAvg <- raster("FRUSHENM/Output/All/Butomus_umbellatus_avg.asc")

## We need to convert the lat long data into spatial points that can be assessed on the raster
{(NAS$Latitude <- round(NAS$Latitude, digits = 4))
 NAS$Longitude <- round(NAS$Longitude, digits = 4)}

rasterResolution <- max(res(ENMAvg))

while(min(nndist(NAS[,1:2])) < rasterResolution){
  nnD <- nndist(NAS[,1:2])
  NAS <- NAS[-(which(min(nnD) == nnD)[1]),]
}

xy_data <- data.frame(x = NAS$Longitude, y = NAS$Latitude)
coordinates(xy_data) <- ~ x + y

## Plot your data points just to make sure everything looks correct and accurate
plot(ENMAvg2)
points(xy_data, pch = 16, cex = .25, col = "black")

## I'm trimming my raster layer down to where I know there's data since the ENM layers generate a lot of cells
# The function we're going to do will evaluate every cell available so be warned
e <- extent(-123, -66, 37, 51)
ex <- as(e, "SpatialPolygons")
ENMAvg2 <- crop(ENMAvg, ex)

## Now we can actually assess the records that are present in the raster
# I'm using the average layer from the ENM however this could probably be done with every layer generated
## This will evaluate every single cell within the raster which can take a while with large raster layers
## The gridRecords function will remove data points based on raster resolution in this case we went from 3742
## down to about 700
grid_pts <- gridRecords(ENMAvg2, xy_data, absences = F)
head(grid_pts)

#The extract function will use every data point on the raster 
## This might be a bit better for what I wanna do which is just determine how many known points are within
## high suitability areas and I want to keep every point
raster_points <- extract(ENMAvg2, NAS)


## Now you can evaluate the data based really on whatever you'd like
# I had a ton of data and cells in the raster so I want to remove all points without an occurrence record
# I also want to see how many data points fall in the higher suitability zone of my ENM
# That threshold is determined by you but Phillips 2017 say that this zone can be a score of 1 and up
