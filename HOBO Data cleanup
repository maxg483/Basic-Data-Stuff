# Acquired HOBO Data collects readings every 30 minutes 
## This means there's lots of data to comb through and make averages for 
### So this will act as a way to create averages for each day and month 
#### This will also act as a way to create a timeline for the day in the month

Test_data <- read.csv("Mentor Marsh Air 1.csv")

MTemp <- Test_data[37:8292,2:3]


#This will tell us how many data points we have per month 

months <- unique(Temp$Date.Time..CST.)

# Now with the data point count we can begin averaging everything 

avglist <- list()

#This will take all the data and average it 
# this will also organize it into the calendar year

for (i in 1:7){
  month <- months[[i]]
  data <- Temp %>%
    filter(Date.Time..CST. == month)
  avg <- mean(data[, 2])
  avglist[[i]] <- avg
}

#This will just make it a bit easier to read

averages <- as.matrix(avglist, nrow = 7, ncol = 2)
